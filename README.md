Algorithms and Data Structures

This is going to be a place where I hold
soltions and explainations to problems
in the different sites for algorithms.

I wish to have soltions from Leetcode,
HackerRank, AlgoExpert, CodeWars.

The languages that I hope to implement all of these in are C++, Swift, Java, Python, and maybe Objective-C.
